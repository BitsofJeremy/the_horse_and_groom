The goal of this challenge is to develop a shop cart. The shop cart should allow users to add and remove products.

The topic selected is beer. You can use the `beers.json` file in the root of the eshop project to get the list of beers for building the Rest API.

## Features
- [X] Create a Rest API with methods to:
  - [X] Get the beers list with page offset and limit.
  - [X] Get beer details by id.
  - [X] Search beers by name, description, tagline, food_pairing, price.
- [X] Create a list of products in the main page.
- [X] Create a search bar to filter the products.
- [X] Navigate to the description page when the user clicks on a product.
- [ ] (Optional) Slicer to filter the products by price.
- [X] Create a shop cart.
  - [X] Add a product to the shop cart.
  - [X] Remove a product from the shop cart.
  - [X] Calculate the total price of the products in the shop cart.

We are using Python and Flask to build the Rest API. The front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
